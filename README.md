As a user I should be able to:

1. Get a random recipe generated for me by clicking on the book

2. Filter if I'm vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free

3. See the randomly generated recipe with recipe name, ingredient list, instructions, and image.

4. If I dont like the recipe shown I can click on a button at the bottom to generate a differnt recipe.
